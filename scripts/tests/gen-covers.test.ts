/**
 * The covers are OURS, and the catalogue has to say so.
 *
 * @module who-iris/scripts/tests/gen-covers.test
 *
 * DSpace generates a `THUMBNAIL` bundle of its own, so a cover this repository
 * rasterised is filed under the same bundle name as one IRIS produced and
 * nothing downstream can tell them apart from the name. The refusal below is
 * the only thing that keeps them apart, so it is the thing tested — against
 * the REAL catalogue, not a fixture, because a fixture would pass on the day
 * somebody removed the declaration from a real node.

/**
 * Render a cover thumbnail for every item whose PDF this repository holds.
 *
 * @module who-iris/scripts/gen-covers
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"do the needed things like extract cover avatar igf
 * neeeded"* — the IRIS home page shows a cover beside each recent submission,
 * and a replica of it without covers is a layout rather than a replica.
 *
 * ## What is generated here is OURS, and the node has to say so
 *
 * DSpace generates a `THUMBNAIL` bundle of its own. **These are not those.**
 * `iris.who.int` is egress-blocked from this environment, so nothing upstream
 * was fetched; each cover is page 1 of a PDF we already hold, rasterised by
 * `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-cover.py`. A node recording one of these without
 * recording the derivation would assert that this repository holds a
 * bitstream IRIS produced, which is false — so this script REFUSES to write a
 * cover for a node whose THUMBNAIL bitstream does not declare it (see
 * `derivedNote` below).
 *
 * That is R8 pointed the other way. R8 says never infer metadata from the PDF
 * when a record exists; this says never let something derived from the PDF
 * pass as something the record supplied.
 *
 * ## The split with the Python
 *
 * `pdf-cover.py` is generic and decides nothing: a page raster is a PDF fact,
 * not a WHO one. This file decides which documents get a cover, where the
 * bytes land, and what the catalogue must say about them. Same split as
 * `pdf-structure.py` / `gen-library-jsonld.ts`.
 *
 * ## `--check` is the thing `yl5w` says is missing
 *
 * Bean `yl5w`: three `materialized` claims in this catalogue resolve to no
 * bytes, and `check:catalogue` does not look. It still does not — that is
 * `yl5w`'s to fix for the whole catalogue. What this adds is the narrow case
 * it is responsible for: every THUMBNAIL bitstream it would write is verified
 * to exist, to match byte for byte, and to match its recorded `sha256` and
 * pixel dimensions. A claim this script makes is a claim this script checks.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run who-iris/scripts/gen-covers.ts
 *   bun run who-iris/scripts/gen-covers.ts --check

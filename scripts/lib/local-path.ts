/**
 * Does a materialisation's `localPath` name bytes that are actually there?
 *
 * @module who-iris/scripts/lib/local-path
 *
 * ## Why this is a module rather than four lines in the checker
 *
 * `check-catalogue.ts` is imperative top to bottom: importing it RUNS the
 * check against the real instance and may `process.exit(1)`. A test that
 * imported it to reach one helper would run the gate as a side effect of
 * loading, and would then be asserting against whatever the corpus happens to
 * hold today rather than against a case it planted. So the decision lives
 * here, where a test can hand it a directory it built — the same split
 * `lib/bytes.ts` already uses.
 *
 * ## Three states, and the third is the whole reason this is not `existsSync`
 *
 * **Unreadable is not absent.** A permissions fault, a broken symlink chain, a
 * filesystem that errors — reporting any of those as "does not exist" sends a
 * reader looking for bytes that are sitting right there, and reporting them as
 * a pass is worse. `could not determine` is its own answer and it is never
 * rendered as clean, which is the rule `check:ci-health` and the health checks
 * keep one level out.
 *
 * A path that names a DIRECTORY is `missing`, not `ok`: `localPath` is where
 * the bytes landed, and a directory is not bytes.

 * and nowhere else. That is deliberate rather than incidental: bean `yl5w`'s
 * three failing claims name bytes that DO exist, one instance over, and a
 * resolver that searched the repository would have called them present and

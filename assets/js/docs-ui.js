/*
 * Docs-site UI: a QR of the current page in the sidebar header, and zoom /
 * full-width controls on the workflow figures.
 *
 * Loaded as an external same-origin script with no inline handlers, so the
 * site needs no script-src relaxation. Nothing here interpolates a URL into
 * markup: the QR carries the address in module geometry, and the caption is
 * set through textContent. The only innerHTML assignment takes the vendored
 * encoder's own <svg>, which is built from bits rather than from the string.
 *
 * Depends on vendor/qrcode.js and vendor/qrcode_UTF8.js being loaded first.
 * Cross-checked by scripts/tests/qr.test.ts, which decodes the encoder's
 * output with an independent reader.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden. Those tests cover the
 * ENCODER. Nothing tests the INTEGRATION -- whether the sidebar markup this
 * script hooks into is really what just-the-docs emits. `_config.yml` uses
 * `remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs` UNPINNED, so that markup can
 * change with no commit in this repo, and the site cannot be built in the
 * environment this was written in (no network for the remote theme, and no
 * DOM library to stand in for a browser).
 *
 * So the mount below DEGRADES LOUDLY rather than silently: several selectors
 * are tried, the control still mounts into the header when the title anchor
 * is not where it expects, and a miss warns to the console naming what was
 * looked for. A feature that quietly does nothing is indistinguishable from
 * a feature nobody clicked. This is mitigation, not verification.

  /* ═══ The site index ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * The translation index used to be inlined into the `<head>` of every page
   * as `<script type="application/json" id="fa-translation-index">`. Measured
   * 2026-10-02 over 1571 pages of one preview: **9.3 KB per page, 14.26 MB in
   * total, and ONE distinct payload** — the largest duplicated payload in a
   * published preview, by a wide margin. It is now published once at
   * `assets/harness/site.json` and fetched here.
   *
   * It was never reader-facing. `mountNavLocale` was its only consumer, so
   * nothing a reader sees moves behind a fetch, and nothing a link checker or
   * the site search index reads moves at all — a `<script>` body is not
   * indexed, and the nav hrefs this rewrites were ALREADY rewritten in the
   * browser before this change.
   *
   * The two obligations that come with building a rendering client-side are in
   * `skills/ui/ui-core/ui-accessibility.md` §"A rendering built client-side
   * owes two things the static one gave for free": print and PDF must wait for
   * load and render, and a load that FAILS must say so. `assets/js/kg-render.js`
   * carries both, and this file reports into it through {@link siteIndexRegion}.
   *
   * ## The island still wins where there is one
   *
   * `getTranslationIndex` reads its island FIRST and falls back to this
   * document. That is not a migration artefact, it is the contract
   * `assets/harness/tiles.json` already states for the tile list: one
   * declaration, two ways it reaches a page. A page Jekyll did not build
   * carries neither the island nor the `<meta>`; an e2e fixture carries the
   * island and has no server to fetch from. Both must work.
   *
   * ## Only `mountNavLocale` waits, and that is deliberate
   *
   * `init()` is a strictly ordered sequence and its own comments say why —
   * `mountActionTiles` before `mountNavIconRow` because the row proxies that
   * panel's button, and `mountDocumentIndex` before `mountInstanceGraphs`
   * because the second MOVES the node the first inserts against. Gating the
   * whole of it on a fetch would put every mount on this page — the figures,
   * the QA panels, the glass — behind one request, which is a far worse
   * failure than a navbar that is not localised.
   *
   * So the fetch gates exactly the one function that needs it.
   * `mountNavLocale` only sets attributes on `.site-nav` and rewrites nav
   * hrefs in place; nothing later in `init()` reads what it wrote.
   *
   * Started at script evaluation rather than at `DOMContentLoaded`: this file
   * is `defer`red, so evaluation happens before that event and the request is
   * usually resolved by the time anything wants it.
   *
   * `SITE_INDEX_WAIT_MS` is the cap. On timeout the index settles as `null`,
   * which `getTranslationIndex` already handles — it is the same answer as a
   * missing island, which is the state that function was written for, and it
   * leaves the navbar exactly as built rather than claiming the folio has no
   * translations.

  /* ── Discarded items — the fsh-guts viewer ─────────────────────────────
   *
   * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"only available under settings at dead fish icon.
   * opening it shows a list of all the nodes in fsh-guts/ (has counter on
   * icon) and use can open dialog to select and display them."*
   *
   * ## Why it is fetched when SETTINGS opens, not on page load
   *
   * The document carries every node's body. Measured: 64 KB with them
   * against 5 KB without. The control lives inside Settings, so its count is
   * not needed until Settings is opened — fetching 64 KB on every page view
   * to populate a badge nobody has looked at would be indefensible. The
   * result is cached for the page, so opening Settings twice fetches once.
   *
   * ## Three states, and the middle one is the whole point
   *
   * The todo tile hides itself when the count is zero, which is right for
   * todos. Doing the same here would be wrong: a FAILED fetch and an empty
   * trashcan would look identical, and they are opposite facts. So
   *
   *   loaded, n > 0   the control, with n in its accessible name
   *   loaded, n === 0 a plain line saying the trashcan is empty
   *   failed          a plain line saying it could not be read, and why
   *
   * ## The body is rendered as TEXT
   *
   * `renderBody` splits on blank lines and emits paragraphs via textContent.
   * No markdown renderer and no sanitiser, deliberately: `fsh-guts/` is a
   * dumping ground anyone may drop a file into, and the safe thing to do
   * with content like that is not to interpret it. A link to the source on
   * the forge is offered for anyone who wants it rendered.

   * where a sticky sent to fsh-guts is restored from, so the send's
   * confirmation can point at something a reader can see on every page,
   * rather than at a control two levels inside ▦ Actions.
   *
   * The button is GENERATED into `.fa-nav-top` (`gen-navbar-include.ts`), with
   * `hidden`, because everything behind it is script: the list is fetched and
   * the restore writes `localStorage`. With no script it stays absent rather
   * than being a button that does nothing (`pb04`).
   *
   * THE COUNT HAS FOUR STATES, and three of them are the ones that must not
   * collapse (the same rule `7vhe` set for the Settings control):
   *
   *   absent   this build published no fsh-guts document and nothing was
   *            discarded here — "–", never "0", because there is nothing to
   *            count, which is a different fact from counting nothing
   *   zero     the document says the trashcan is empty, and so does this browser
   *   some     n, the document's nodes plus this browser's discards
   *   error    the document could not be read — "?", never "0"
   *
   * THE FETCH NOW HAPPENS ON EVERY PAGE, and that reverses a recorded trade:
   * the Settings control fetched only on open because the document is ~64 KB.
   * A count that is always on screen cannot wait for a click. So the fetch
   * waits for idle instead of for load, and the browser's HTTP cache serves
   * the repeat views; the bytes are paid once per cache lifetime, not per page.

   * That is what makes an autoplaying loop defensible here at all. WCAG

  /* ── The glyph a tile wears, by declared NAME ────────────────────────
   *
   * Every graph tile wore NET_GLYPH — the graph-as-a-thing-to-browse net —
   * because a tile had no way to say otherwise. `VisualisationSchema.icon`
   * gives it one, and this is the registry that name resolves against.
   *
   * A NAME rather than markup, and the reason is not style. `tileLink` assigns
   * its glyph with `innerHTML`, so a declaration carrying SVG would make
   * `<instance>.json` an HTML injection site — and a declaration is INHERITED,
   * reaching this instance from a dependency through `resolveSkillDirs`. The
   * markup would not even have to be authored by somebody with commit access
   * here. R17's rule, one surface along: allow-list, default-deny.
   *
   * `hasOwnProperty` and not `TILE_GLYPHS[name]`, because the name comes from
   * a declaration: `"constructor"` and `"toString"` are inherited properties
   * of every object literal, and a bare lookup would hand one of them to
   * `innerHTML`.
   *
   * An unknown name falls back rather than failing. The registry ships with
   * the site and the declaration is authored apart from it, so a folio may
   * name a glyph a slightly older platform has not got; a tile that vanished
   * over that would turn a cosmetic mismatch into a missing navigation entry.
   * The fallback is exactly what every tile rendered before this existed.

   * three outlined beans crowd until the hilums merge into one grey mass;
   * three filled with an oval cut-out read as olives; a filled crescent
   * collapses to a speck. At two beans the shapes and their hilums stay
   * separate at 20px and the drawing still looks like the reference at 64.

  /**
   * The header's controls, as ONE launcher over a grid of same-sized tiles.
   *
   * ## Why one, and not five
   *
   * There were four header buttons -- theme, reading preferences, language, QR
   * -- inside a row just-the-docs caps at `3.75rem` and shares with the site
   * title. The owner's words were "that navbar is getting crowded", and adding
   * the knowledge-graph viewer and the source link to that row would have made
   * it six. One launcher takes the row from four icons to one.
   *
   * The alternative reading of the request -- a row of icons that each open a
   * tile-sized panel -- takes it from four to five and makes the stated
   * problem worse, which is what decided it.
   *
   * ## The tile is the QR panel's footprint
   *
   * "build out to the size of the QR code. use that as kind of the template
   * size for action icons". So the panel is exactly the region the QR code
   * already occupies -- `16.5rem` in the sidebar column -- and every view
   * renders into it. Nothing here introduces a new place for content to appear.
   *
   * ## The panel is a SIBLING of the header
   *
   * Unchanged, and load-bearing: `.site-header` is a hard-capped row, so a
   * panel left inside it is clipped. `mountPanelInSidebarColumn` puts it in
   * `.side-bar`'s flex column where it pushes the nav down instead of covering
   * it. Three separate panels used to solve this three different ways, one of
   * them by opening upward into the staging banner; there is now one panel and
   * one answer.
   *
   * ## Accessibility (bean `gjli`)
   *
   * Tiles are 4rem tall, well over the 24px SC 2.5.8 floor, because this
   * instance's declared interaction profile is low-dexterity and a target that
   * is barely legal is a target that is hard to hit. Every tile is a real

    /* ── Two mini-icons, between the title and the launcher ──────────────
     *
     * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"can you put dark/light mode switch in mini-icon on
     * top as well as language icon. to right of folio-asst, to left of the
     * [3x3 checkboard]"* — the checkerboard being this launcher, confirmed in
     * the same exchange.
     *
     * ## This partly reverses `1le7`, deliberately and on the owner's word
     *
     * That bean collapsed FOUR header icons into one launcher because "that
     * navbar is getting crowded", and the comment on `tileButton` below still
     * refuses a dedicated search magnifier for exactly that reason. The two
     * are not in conflict and the difference is worth stating, because the
     * next reader will otherwise "fix" one of them:
     *
     *   - search was refused because it would save ONE PRESS on a control
     *     reached twice a session, and the owner answered "search is two";
     *   - these two were ASKED FOR by name.
     *
     * A row of three is not the row of six `1le7` was avoiding. If a fourth
     * is ever proposed, that is the point to go back and ask.
     *
     * ## Language OPENS the launcher rather than duplicating its view
     *
     * The button presses the same `showView("language")` the tile does, so
     * there is one language panel and one copy of its state. A second bar
     * built here would look identical and drift — the failure this file's
     * header calls out, and the reason the search field is MOVED rather than
     * rebuilt. The mini-button is a shortcut INTO the panel, not a second
     * panel.

    /* ── The search: a magnifier at the top of the display window ─────────
     *
     * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"search that should be a collsaible icon/avatar on
     * top of display window... that when open is full span width of all
     * avaioblae"* (issue #1715).
     *
     * ## THIS REPLACES THE NAVBAR/CORNER PAIR, and the old design is recorded
     *
     * 2026-09-21 (`rx6k`) put the field back in the display panel's top row
     * with a "Hide search" control that slid it to a FIXED upper-right card;
     * 2026-09-23 made it *"start open full top of display panel"*. Measured on
     * a local build before this change: the open row cost 48px of every page
     * at 1280px and 42px at 390px before the first line of content, results
     * were capped at the theme's 536px under a 992px field, on a phone the
     * "Hide search" button left the field 215px of 390, and Escape did
     * nothing. The fixed corner card was also the one control on the page
     * drawn over content at the top right, which on a phone is where the
     * theme's own menu button sits.
     *
     * So there is ONE place and TWO states, and the place does not move:
     *
     *   closed  the magnifier alone, at the inline-end of the glass band's
     *           row (issue #2201; it was floated in the panel until then).
     *           `aria-expanded="false"`.
     *   open    the field across the rest of the band, then the magnifier —
     *           in the SAME place, with the same look — and everything that
     *           is not the field (results, the theme's status lines, a
     *           preview's notice) dropped below it. Focus goes into the
     *           field. `aria-expanded="true"`.
     *
     * The magnifier is the toggle in both states, and Escape anywhere inside
     * closes and returns focus to it (`l4zi`: the inverse is always the same
     * control, in the same place). What survives from 2026-09-23 is the
     * owner's *"maginfyingglass avatar/braadning should be visibile always"*:
     * the glyph is on screen in both states.
     *
     * ## Why in the panel's flow and not fixed to the window
     *
     * PR #1709 puts a fixed strip (`.fa-glass-band`, z 89) behind the Folio
     * handle at the top CENTRE while the page scrolls. A second fixed control
     * at the top would have to negotiate that strip, the staging banner and
     * the phone header's menu button; one in flow negotiates none of them.
     * It sits at the top of the display panel, below the header band the
     * handle lives in, and scrolls UNDER the strip like any other content.
     * Mid-page, the Search tile in the launcher reveals it and the focus
     * scroll lands it below the strip (`scroll-padding-top`, same PR).
     *
     * ## Moved, never rebuilt — UNCHANGED, and still the load-bearing part
     *
     * The theme's own script binds to the input it rendered. A search box
     * reconstructed here would look identical and do nothing. So the theme's
     * `.search` container is MOVED, with its input, its label and its results
     * list intact, and every handler moves with it because handlers belong to
     * elements and not to positions.
     *
     * ## It must never leave the document — ALSO UNCHANGED
     *
     * just-the-docs looks its input up by id when it initialises, and
     * `getElementById` does not find a detached node. So the holder lives
     * inside `searchHome`, which is in the document from mount, and the two
     * states are an attribute on `searchHome` — closing is `display: none` on
     * the holder, never a removal.
     *
     * ## Absent is a real state
     *
     * `search_enabled: false`, or a theme that renamed the container, means
     * there is nothing to adopt. Nothing is mounted, no magnifier is drawn,
     * and the warning says what was looked for.
     */

     * magnifier in the header row: one press instead of two. Do not make
     * it."* — citing the row's 3.75rem cap, bean `1le7`, and an answer of
     * "search is two" given by the owner on 2026-09-19.
     *
     * The owner reversed it on 2026-09-21: *"i want the search restored back
     * to the top display navbar, with option to slide out to the UR corner as
     * an icon."* Quoted rather than deleted, because the next agent to read a
     * prohibition the code plainly violates will assume the CODE is wrong and
     * revert working behaviour to satisfy a dead instruction.
     *
     * ## And the reversal did not cost the row
     *
     * Worth noting, because it is why the old objection does not simply
     * reapply in a new form: search did NOT come back as a fourth icon in the
     * capped sidebar header. It went to the MAIN DISPLAY navbar, which is
     * where just-the-docs renders it and which has the width. The sidebar row
     * is the mark, the scheme bulb, the globe and the launcher — three icons
     * beside the title, which is what `1le7` costed.
     *
     * ## Why this is an action and not a view
     *
     * The tile used to drag the live field into the sidebar panel. With
     * search visible in the navbar that is strictly worse: the same field
     * would be in two places depending on how you got to it, and a reader who
     * closed the panel would find search had moved. So the tile calls
     * `revealSearch`, which un-collapses the field where it lives and focuses
     * it. One search box, one home, two ways to reach it.

  // A figure expanded to the full display width therefore hides anything in
  // the sidebar, the QR code included, and no z-index on the code can rescue
  // it from inside that stacking context.
  //
  // So the root carries a flag saying "something is full width right now", and
  // the stylesheet uses it to let the code out of the sidebar's stacking
  // context and pin it. Recomputed from the DOM rather than counted, because a
  // counter drifts the moment a figure is removed or re-mounted.
  /* ── Automatic full width ────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* A workflow diagram is drawn far wider than the text column it lands in, so
     it arrives shrunk to the point where the label inside a task box is not
     readable -- and the reader has to notice a toolbar and press a button
     before the page shows them the thing the page is about.

     So a figure that is genuinely wider than its column now starts expanded.
     Three conditions, because auto-expanding the wrong figure is worse than
     not auto-expanding at all:

       - the viewport is wide enough for full width to mean anything (the same
         50rem the CSS uses -- on a phone the column IS the display);
       - the drawing's own coordinate width exceeds the column by a clear
         margin, so a figure that already fits is left alone;
       - the reader has not turned it off. That last one is the difference
         between a default and an imposition: press "Full width" to collapse a
         figure and the choice is remembered, and nothing auto-expands again.

     The stored value is READ, not just written. `fa-locale` was stored by this

  /* ═══ Sticky todos ════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * A TODO is a person's outstanding item, published by `gen-docs-pages.ts`
   * to `/assets/todos/index.json`. This mounts three surfaces over it:
   *
   *   - a tile in the action launcher, carrying a COUNT;
   *   - a board in the MAIN display, with every sticky lined up;
   *   - a sticky that can be lifted off the board and pinned to the page.
   *
   * ## Why the board is not a tile view
   *
   * Every other tile renders into `.fa-tiles-view`, which is the QR panel's
   * footprint -- 16.5rem in the sidebar column. The owner asked for the board
   * "in the main display", and a wall of stickies at 16.5rem would be a
   * single column of slivers. So the tile is a LAUNCHER for a surface that
   * lives in `.main-content`, and the panel machinery is left alone rather
   * than widened for one caller.
   *
   * ## Content reaches the DOM through textContent, never innerHTML
   *
   * A todo's `summary` and `comment` are authored -- by a person, or by an
   * agent on their behalf -- and travel through a JSON file to this page. The
   * only glyphs built with `innerHTML` here are the static SVG constants
   * above, which no input touches. That is the same rule the QA panel's
   * evidence follows, and for the same reason: the string that closes a tag
   * is exactly the string somebody eventually writes.
   *
   * ## The pencil is `.fa-node-edit`, not an editor
   *
   * "default pattern for any content object in just-the-docs -- it should be
   * at that class level". `gen-docs-pages.ts` already emits that affordance
   * per node, and `editHref` is composed there at build time, so this file
   * carries no repo URL. A published page cannot write back to the repo, and
   * the honest control is the one that takes you where writing happens.

   * but assume they can open a full screen panel w/ fixed controls like [x] or
   * [linksrc] or [edit] or what not depedning on conent."*
   *
   * CRDM Q7 settled the line: `[x]` is in the same place with the same
   * behaviour on every panel, so a reader learns the frame once; everything
   * else is the kind's to offer.
   *
   * THREE STATES, and collapsing any two loses a fact: not declared (this kind
   * does not offer it), declared and servable (the control), declared and
   * unservable (no control, AND a reason). The third is the one that gets
   * lost, and `pb04` is the case already paid for — an `[edit]` the pipeline
   * cannot perform 404s for exactly the reader who cannot edit, which reads as
   * "this page is broken" rather than "you cannot do this".
   *
   * Mirrors `schemas/panel-chrome.ts`, which this file cannot import. Same
   * cost, same mitigation as `window-stack.ts`: the e2e asserts the browser's
   * answer against the model's, case for case.

  /* ── Where a declared, site-root path is composed ────────────────────
   *
   * `graph-tiles.ts` stores a tile's href relative to the SITE ROOT — `/beans/`
   * — which is right, and is what `harness.links[].path` stores as well. Every
   * other consumer of such a path hands it to Liquid's `relative_url`, which
   * prepends `site.baseurl`. A tile cannot: it is composed here, after Liquid
   * has finished, from JSON on a `<meta>`.
   *
   * SO IT HAS TO BE DONE HERE, AND IT WAS NOT — issue #801. This site serves
   * from `/folio-assistant`, so an unprefixed `/beans/` resolves against the
   * ORIGIN and every one of the twelve tiles 404ed. The rule was already
   * written down 800 lines above, on the action tiles: *"an absolute `/kg/`
   * is a 404 rather than a wrong-looking link"*. Two tile families, one rule,
   * and only one of them was following it.
   *
   * NOT applied inside `tileLink`, which both families share. The action tiles
   * are handed `#fa-site-links` values that Liquid ALREADY composed, so
   * prefixing there would double the base and break the family that works.
   * The base belongs where the raw declared value enters, which is here.
   *
   * An ABSENT meta falls back to `baseurlFromTodoSrc`, and then to `""`. The
   * empty answer is the previous behaviour and is deliberate: a site with no
   * baseurl is the common case (the e2e fixtures, a local `jekyll serve`),
   * and it is indistinguishable from a declared empty one — `site.baseurl`
   * renders as the empty string for both. There is nothing here to report as
   * a finding.
   *
   * ## ONE function, because there were briefly two
   *
   * A second `siteBaseurl` was defined ~500 lines below this one, deriving
   * the prefix from `meta[name="fa-todo-src"]` for the sticky art. Same name,
   * same IIFE scope — so the later declaration silently replaced this one,
   * and `withBase` began asking a meta that the graph-tile fixtures do not
   * carry. Every tile lost its base, which is issue #801 coming straight back
   * on a merge that touched neither feature.
   *
   * The two were never different questions. `fa-baseurl` is the DECLARED
   * answer, written by Liquid from `site.baseurl`; the todo-src derivation is
   * a RECONSTRUCTION for a page that has the one meta and not the other. So
   * the declared value wins and the derivation is the fallback, which is the
   * only order that cannot make a page contradict its own server.

  /* ═══ Move and resize — keyboard FIRST, drag as the accelerator ═══════
   *
   * Owner: *"can resize open content, move around. drag and drop moving.."*
   * and, on the floor every board control sits on, *"ALWAYS collapsable to
   * linearly rendablee"*.
   *
   * **Drag is the accelerator, never the only way in.** This instance's
   * declared interaction profile is low-dexterity — it is why the Pin control
   * is a button rather than a drag — and a board whose only affordance is drag
   * excludes its own owner. So the keyboard path is built first and the
   * pointer path is added over it, rather than the other way round where the
   * keyboard half is the thing that never gets finished.
   *
   * ## A MODE, because arrows already mean something
   *
   * Arrow keys scroll. A window that moved whenever a reader pressed one while
   * reading it would have stolen the page's own navigation, so moving is a
   * mode: the `move` control turns it on, the window says so, arrows move,
   * `Shift`+arrows resize, and `Escape` or `Enter` leaves. The mode is
   * announced rather than merely styled — a reader who cannot see the outline
   * has to be told what their arrow keys now do.
   *
   * ## SESSION-ONLY, like the stack above it
   *
   * `schemas/board-positions.ts` is where a move becomes durable, and
   * `moveBy` is the function that does it — for a tool or an agent, against
   * the repository. A published page cannot write that file, and the lesson
   * `db7g` settled applies unchanged: it is better to be a control over this
   * reader's view and say so than to look like it changed the folio.

     *     nothing is saved. A drag the reader cannot take back is a gesture
     *     with no inverse, which is `l4zi` for pointers.
     *

   *
   * Owner: *"confrim arctions [fishbones] on open content puts in fsh guts"*,
   * and CRDM Q5: **delete becomes MOVE**. `processes/board-relocate.bpmn`
   * is the drawn process; this is its reader-facing half.
   *
   * ## THE CONFIRM IS THE REQUIREMENT, AND IT MUST NOT OVERSTATE EITHER WAY
   *
   * `deletion-requires-confirmation` names the failure: a dialog that says
   * "remove?" when it means "unpublish everywhere". The same lie pointed the
   * other way is just as bad, and it is the one THIS surface could tell — a
   * published page cannot move a file in the repository, so a dialog
   * promising "off the site, everywhere" would be describing something that
   * did not happen.
   *
   * So the dialog says exactly two things: what this does (takes the card off
   * THIS BROWSER's board, reversibly, from the trashcan tile), and what it
   * does not (move the content out of the folio at all). Naming the second is
   * not an apology; it is the difference between a reader thinking they
   * cleared something for the team and knowing they did not.
   *
   * THE SCOPE IS THE OWNER'S, settled 2026-09-21 when `db7g` could not meet
   * its own first line: **reader-local is the whole feature.** The fishbone is
   * a control over one reader's view, and the durable relocation is not the
   * board's — so this dialog describes a per-reader action rather than
   * promising a repository change that is coming. `board-relocate.bpmn`'s
   * `A_MoveContent` is the AGENT's path to fsh-guts and is not wired to this
   * control; wiring them would re-open the question the owner just closed.
   *
   * ## ONE PATH, shared with `d1r6`
   *
   * The relocation itself is `discardTodo` — the same function, the same
   * `localStorage` key, the same `fa:todos-discarded` event the trashcan
   * counter already listens to. The bean asked for one path rather than a
   * second answer, and a second store would have been two counts of one thing.

   * site-ROOT-absolute with no baseurl — and this site is served from
   * `/folio-assistant/` on the canonical deploy and

   * depend on an unrelated feature being switched on. It is now FETCHED as
   * well (2026-10-02), so reading it here would also make the art wait on a
   * request: a second reason for the same answer.
   *
   * `meta[name="fa-todo-src"]` is the honest source: it is emitted through
   * `relative_url`, so the SERVER has already resolved the prefix, and the
   * board does not mount at all without it. Stripping the known suffix gives
   * the prefix the same page used to fetch the index itself.

  /* ── Discarding a sticky (bean `d1r6`) ─────────────────────────────────

   * that should now be replaced with it going into the fsh-guts. icon there
   * should be crumpled sticky."*
   *
   * ## What "into the fsh-guts" can mean on a static site
   *
   * The published `fsh-guts.jsonld` is built from the repository; a page has
   * no way to write to it. So a discard here is **per-viewer and
   * per-browser**, in `localStorage`, exactly like the reading preferences.
   *
   * **The UI says so, in words, wherever a discarded item appears.** A reader
   * who thinks they have cleared a todo for the team when they have cleared
   * it for themselves has been misled by the control, and that is a worse
   * failure than not having the control.
   *
   * ## It is a discard, not a delete — `fsh-guts`'s whole rule
   *
   * "Delete means relocate", and a thing in the trashcan can be read, cited
   * and restored. So a discarded sticky is listed in the Discarded view with
   * a Restore control beside it. A one-way dismiss would carry the crumpled
   * icon while breaking the rule the icon stands for.
   *
   * ## Removing the × does not strand anyone
   *
   * The × returned a FLOATING sticky to the board, and the board already
   * offers that a second way: the greyed slot entry is a real button that
   * docks it (owner: *"can also return the sticky note by clicking
   * disabled"*). So the close control's old job survives without it.

   * The `<picture>` a themed sticky renders its art in.

   * MARKUP, not a CSS background, and the reason is recorded on the stylesheet
   * rule this feeds: `<picture>` swaps the FILE at a breakpoint and
   * `background-image: url(...)` can only name one crop. Serving the wide crop
   * to a phone is a bug this repository has already shipped once.
   *
   * TWO sources, not three. The `card` crop is the default because a todo
   * sticky IS a board card — dense, roughly square — and `mobile` takes over
   * below 30rem where a square card has the least room on the tallest screen.
   * The `laptop` crop is deliberately unused here: it is composed for a
   * page-width surface, and handing it to a card would show the art's quiet
   * area in the wrong place. The landing sticky still uses all three, because
   * it really is a page-width surface at the top end.
   *
   * `alt=""` and `aria-hidden`: this is decoration behind text that already
   * says everything. A description of the cat would be read out before every
   * todo on the board.

   * pictures depending on the window — and the square is the crop the avatar
   * is cut from, so it is the one that reads as this theme's cat.

   *
   * Owner, 2026-10-02: *"dont treat stickies differently. combine best of
   * each. lower faded avatar/theme looks nicer. upper smaller same size
   * closed looks niceer. icons are a mess on both. make compact underneath.
   * [x] is what? send to fsh-guts? make sure confirmed by user"*.
   *
   * So a landing sticky and a todo sticky are drawn by the SAME two functions:
   *
   *   `stickyTile`     the closed sticky — small, every one the same size, the
   *                    theme's art behind a scrim (the todo stickies' faded
   *                    look), its title on top. Pressing it opens the shared
   *                    board window (`openWindowFor`).
   *   `stickyActions`  ONE compact icon row UNDER it, always in this order:
   *                    view, edit, pin, send to fsh-guts. Nothing inside the
   *                    card body.
   *
   * The two callers differ only in what the buttons DO — a landing sticky
   * pins a copy of its server-rendered card, a todo pins a built one — and
   * never in what the reader sees. View and Edit stay ABSENT, not disabled,
   * when the pipeline has no forge (`pb04`); the order of what is present
   * never changes.
   *
   * THE INVERSE OF EVERY ACTION IS ON THE SAME ROW OR ONE CLICK AWAY (`l4zi`).
   * Pin is a toggle: pressed, it returns the sticky from the glass. Send to
   * fsh-guts asks first (`confirmSendToFshGuts`) and the dialog names where
   * the sticky can be restored from.

   *
   * The first proposal was a visually-hidden name. The owner rejected it —

   * there is only one.
   *
   * ## What it strips, and what it deliberately does not
   *
   * Markdown list markers, blockquote carets, heading hashes and every run of
   * whitespace — the structure that makes prose readable DOWN a card and
   * unreadable ACROSS one. It does not truncate: cutting at a character count
   * puts the elision in the model, where a stylesheet cannot undo it for a

     * not land in a text box, and one who wants to fix it should not have to
     * find the button"*. Present is what it asked for; competing with a
     * one-line summary is not. Both are still here, still keyboard-reachable,

    // one icon row under every sticky (`stickyActions`), with View and Edit,
    // in the same order on a landing sticky and a todo. The card keeps only
    // what it needs once FLOATING on the glass — Move and Return, added by
    // `float` — because a floating card has no row beneath it.

   * the page. A pointer drag cannot be operated from a keyboard without
   * reimplementing the whole interaction -- arrow-key nudging, a grab mode, an
   * escape hatch -- and this instance's declared interaction profile is
   * low-dexterity, where a drag is the single worst control to depend on.
   *
   * So the gesture is a BUTTON: Pin lifts the sticky onto the page, Close
   * returns it. It is one keystroke either way, it needs no pointer at all,
   * and nothing about it is harder with a mouse than a drag would have been.
   * Drag can be added ON TOP later as an accelerator; it must not be the only
   * way in.
   *
   * ## A floating sticky is greyed on the board, not removed from it
   *
   * The owner's words: "when floating, they are greyed out on sticky panel but
   * can also return the sticky note by clicking disabled." So the board keeps
   * every sticky in a stable position -- a list that reflows when you pin one
   * makes the next one you want move under your cursor -- and the greyed entry
   * is a real button that docks it again.

  /**
   * THE GLASS — the reader's folio, pulled down over whatever they are
   * browsing. R25: *"the user in visualization should be able to pull down
   * their folio."*
   *
   * ## Why this is its own function, and what the move cost before it
   *
   * The layer already existed and was already `document.body`'s, fixed to the
   * viewport — structurally a glass. It was created INSIDE `mountTodoBoard`,
   * after two guards that have nothing to do with a glass:
   *
   *   mountTodoStickies -> fetchTodoIndex -> `if (items === null) return`
   *   mountTodoBoard    -> `if (!main) return null`   (#main-content / main)
   *
   * So the folio existed only on a page that had a just-the-docs main region
   * AND a readable todo index. A `who-iris` replica page has neither — its
   * own `<style>`, no Jekyll, no `<main>` — which is why bean `jpjt` measured
   * `docs-ui.js` 0 / boards 0 / tiles 0 there and concluded F8/F9 was blocked
   * on this. **A folio that only exists where a board mounted is not a folio
   * a reader carries between libraries.**
   *
   * ## Idempotent, and it returns the SAME layer the board floats into
   *
   * Called from `init` before anything else and again by `mountTodoBoard`.
   * One layer or the glass and the board would be two surfaces that agree
   * only by accident — the shape `harness-tiles` calls two registries.
   *
   * ## An empty glass still comes down
   *
   * `.fa-sticky-layer:empty { display: none }` hides a layer with no children,
   * which is right for a float layer and wrong for a glass: "nothing on your
   * glass" and "the glass is broken" are opposite facts, and the first is a
   * state a reader reaches by tidying. The open glass therefore always holds
   * its own chrome, so it is never `:empty` while open.

   *
   * ## THREE states, and the middle one is the whole point
   *
   * | state | here | how it got there |
   * |---|---|---|
   * | in the library | **no entry at all** | the default |
   * | in the folio, not displayed | an entry with `shown: false` | the reader closed it |
   * | on the glass | an entry with `shown: true` | the reader pulled it out |
   *
   * `board-windows`: *"A two-state model — in the folio, or not — makes
   * closing a sticky and un-materialising an asset the same gesture. A reader
   * tidying their glass would then silently discard work, and would have no
   * way to tell that they had."*
   *
   * **So `close` sets a flag and NEVER removes the entry.** That is why the
   * store keys on an object rather than holding an array of ids the way
   * `fa:todos-discarded` does: with an array, "closed" and "never pulled out"
   * are the same absence, and the middle state cannot be represented at all.
   * The data shape enforces the rule rather than the call sites remembering
   * it.
   *
   * ## The way back is from the LIBRARY, and that is checkable
   *
   * *"Putting it back on the glass is a separate act performed from the
   * library — not from the glass it just left."* So `shelve` is called by the
   * glass and `display` only ever by a library row. `l4zi` one level out: the
   * inverse of close must be reachable, and here it is reachable from a
   * DIFFERENT SURFACE than the one that closed it. The thing to check when
   * implementing close is that the library offers the way back.
   *
   * ## It is per-viewer and per-browser, and the UI says so
   *
   * A published page cannot write to the repository, so this is
   * `localStorage`, exactly like the reading preferences and the discarded
   * todos. The rule that mechanism already states applies unchanged and is
   * the reason it is restated here: *"A reader who thinks they have cleared a
   * todo for the team when they have cleared it for themselves has been
   * misled by the control, and that is a worse failure than not having the
   * control."*
   *
   * Every read and write is wrapped. `localStorage` throws in a private
   * window and returns null with site data cleared, and a folio that threw
   * would take the whole page's scripts with it.

   * scroll positions. The line stayed readable either side of it, and a link
   * centred under it opened the glass instead.

   * runs across the content column behind it. Text scrolls UNDER the strip,
   * the way it scrolls under any sticky bar, rather than past the pill with
   * its middle missing. `scroll-padding-top` in `docs-ui.css` keeps an anchor
   * jump or a focus scroll from landing a target under the strip.

   * 1280px).
   *
   * Now there is ONE row: the band, `position: sticky` at the top of the

   * TWO MODES, and the second is the old one unchanged. A page with none of

   * `placeHandleBand` shows behind the handle only while scrolled, so its
   * resting layout gains no empty row. The first control to arrive moves the
   * band into the content column and marks it `data-fa-band-tools`, which
   * `placeHandleBand`'s update then leaves alone.
   *
   * Mounted where the magnifier was: `.main-content-wrap`, never hidden by
   * the theme (`.main-header` is, below its nav breakpoint, which once made

     * Owner, 2026-09-24: *"exploding icon outlines the avatar but appears to
     * do nothing else."* The exploding icon is ✜, the card's Move control.
     * What it was meant to do is written on it and in `zrvt`: *"✥ enters move
     * mode, arrows move, Shift+arrows resize, Escape or Enter leaves"* — and
     * it did exactly that. But the only thing a SIGHTED reader was shown was
     * the dashed outline; the sentence saying what the arrow keys now do went
     * to a screen-reader live region and nowhere else. To a reader with a
     * mouse the mode looked like a button that draws a box.
     *
     * So while a card is in the mode this bar says the same sentence where it
     * can be read, and offers the mode's own step — the one `nudge` takes for
     * an arrow press — as four buttons, plus Done. Nothing new is decided
     * here: the steps, the resize chord and the ways out are the mode's, and
     * the buttons call the SAME step through `wireMove`'s controller. They are
     * the pointer path to the mode for a reader who cannot comfortably press
     * arrow keys, as its −/+ are for size, and the declared profile here
     * is low-dexterity (WCAG 2.5.7).
     *
     * In the ZOOM BAR's row, because that row is sticky to the top of the

     * at full size however far it is zoomed out — a bar drawn on the card

     * case they need again."*

     * The confirm names the place the way back is, and links it — `l4zi` one
     * level out (`board-windows`: *"the thing to check is that the library
     * offers the way back"*), now said at the moment of closing rather than
     * left for the reader to remember. It also says what does NOT happen: the
     * asset stays in the folio, which is the three-state rule in words.
     *
     * THREE PLACES, because there are three kinds of card (#1926 added the
     * third): a LIBRARY card goes back to its instance's library, a TODO to
     * the Todos board, and a pinned LANDING STICKY to the page it was pinned
     * from. Calling a sticky "your Todos" sent the reader to a list it was
     * never on. `returnPlaceOf` is the one answer, read by the confirm, the
     * after-the-fact status and the x button's own label.
     *
     * The dialog is `confirmDialog`, the page's one confirm (focus on the
     * safe choice, Escape cancels and is stopped before the glass's own
     * Escape), mounted inside the layer for the glass's theme tokens and with

     * themed square sticky avatar faded with markdown overlayed when stikcy
     * poopped out."* What popped out was a wide card with a generic yellow
     * note in the middle and none of the note's words.
     *
     * THE SAME THEMED STICKY, NOT A SECOND LOOK. The card takes the todo's
     * `data-fa-sticky-theme` and `fa-sticky--backdrop`, and its art comes
     * from `buildBackdrop` — the attribute, class and function the board's
     * sticky (`buildSticky`) and the landing stickies already use. So the
     * art's crop and clipping, the SCRIM that fades it, and the theme's ink
     * all come from `themes.css` and the backdrop rules as they are; nothing
     * here sets a colour or restates a fade. The note's words are
     * `renderBody(comment, { markdown: true })` — the board's body renderer,
     * asked for markdown.
     *
     * The theme and the words live in the published todo index, not in the
     * reader's folio (which keeps a title and a link), so they are read from

     * Owner, 2026-09-23: *"add to cat-harness harness visualize a config
     * panel/popup which shows properties of cat-harness and other instances.
     * add in to render appropraite edit skills as well."* The design is the
     * owner's pick from `docs/wireframes/harness-config/`, **Hybrid**: this
     * glass panel, grouped Instantiated here / In this checkout / Associated
     * ↗ remote, with a property table and the skills that edit each property;
     * and a ⚙ on every sidebar divider that opens it with that harness chosen.
     *
     * Every value is GENERATED (`harness-panel.ts` → `_data/harness.json` →
     * `assets/harness/config.json`). This decides nothing but layout. */

     * owner chose **"Few + a More tile"**: the glass's own tiles (Todos,
     * Filter, Settings) stay on the strip, and ONE More tile opens a panel
     * listing every declared visualisation.
     *
     * The list is the SAME declaration filtered to the `glass` surface and
     * drawn by the same `renderGraphTiles`: moving the tiles into a panel
     * changes where they are, not what they are. */

     * own and every declared visualisation — lives on the strip or in More,
     * as the reader chooses, and More itself never leaves the strip: it is the
     * way to everything that is not there.
     *
     * DRAGGING IS THE ACCELERATOR, never the only way (WCAG 2.5.7, and this
     * instance's declared low-dexterity profile). Every tile in More has a
     * "Strip" button and every strip tile is listed with a "More" button, so
     * the whole arrangement can be made by pressing.

   * Pin used to write a SECOND store (`fa-pinned-stickies`) and clone the

   * folio-glass item: no glass tools, no folio geometry, no shelve, and the
   * glass's filter and count had to special-case it. Two stores answering
   * "what is on my glass" is the defect.
   *
   * So a pinned sticky IS a folio asset now — `todo/<id>` (the key the glass's
   * own Todos panel already pulls a todo out under, so the two ways onto the
   * glass agree about which todo is there) or `landing/<slot>` — with
   * `shown: true`, drawn by the glass's own card path (`buildGlassCard` and
   * `dressGlassSticky`), placed by `placeOnGlass`. Unpin is `shelveFromGlass`:
   * the entry stays, and the row's pin is the way back (`l4zi`). The pin's
   * pressed state is `folioStateOf(key) === "glass"` — asked of the store,
   * never remembered by the button.
   *
   * ## The home is RECORDED, not remembered
   *
   *   a panel  `data-fa-home-panel="<panel>"`   (the landing board, the todo board)
   *   a slot   `data-fa-home-slot="<id>"`        (one per sticky it holds)

   * notions of "on top" waiting to disagree.
   *
   * THE CARD STAYS IN ITS SLOT, hidden by the tile class rather than removed,
   * because it is still the sticky's home (`pv6g`): Pin clones it, and a page

   * from any page.
   *
   * ## Why this runs at mount rather than at page load
   *
   * The listing must stay OPEN when the board did not mount, and "did not
   * mount" includes the two cases a reader cannot distinguish from the

  /* ── The navbar filters by the selected locale ───────────────────────── */

  /*
   * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, in the owner's words (2026-09-19):
   *
   *   "i have english selected, but i see the translated pages in LHS navbar."
   *
   * Two halves, and only the second is here.
   *
   * The first half is `nav_exclude: true` on every translated page. The nav is
   * built by just-the-docs AT BUILD TIME, from front matter, on a static site
   * that is serving the same HTML to every reader. It cannot know which locale
   * anybody selected, so a translated page left in it is in it FOR EVERYBODY.
   * No amount of client-side work fixes that: a script can swap a nav item,
   * it cannot un-render one without a flash of the wrong nav first. So the
   * translations leave the static nav entirely, and the navbar a reader gets
   * with no JavaScript at all is the SOURCE-LANGUAGE one -- which is the
   * correct degraded answer rather than an arbitrary one.
   *
   * The second half is this function. With a non-source locale selected, each
   * nav item that HAS a page in that locale is rewritten IN PLACE -- same
   * position, same parent, translated title, translated href. "In place of",
   * not "in addition to", is the requirement, and rewriting rather than
   * inserting is what makes it structurally true rather than something the
   * ordering has to be trusted to preserve.
   *
   * FALLBACK IS THE ABSENCE OF A REWRITE. An item with no page in the selected
   * locale is not touched, so it keeps its source-language title and link.
   * There is deliberately no code path for it: a fallback implemented as its
   * own branch is a branch that can be wrong, and this one cannot be.
   *
   * ## Three states, and the third is why the index is published as `null`
   *
   *   ok        -- the index parsed; filter the nav.
   *   empty     -- it parsed and holds no pages; nothing to swap, and every
   *                item correctly stays in the source language.
   *   unknown   -- no island, or it would not parse, or `index` is `null`
   *                because the data file was absent at build time. The nav is
   *                left EXACTLY as built and nothing is claimed.
   *
   * `empty` and `unknown` produce the same navbar and are not the same answer:
   * one is "this folio has no translations", the other is "this build could not
   * tell". They are recorded separately in `data-fa-nav-index` so that a
   * reader, a test, or the next person debugging this can distinguish them --
   * the same rule the README sections and the CI-health report follow.

     * '⚠️ Unverified translation — This page has been translated
     * automatically and has not been reviewed by a subject-matter expert.'
     * which then can open to the full trnslation QA report."*
     *
     * It was four lines of banner above the page title — the warning, the
     * source, and two tool names a reader cannot run from a browser. On a
     * translated page that is the first thing between the reader and the
     * content they came for, every page, permanently.
     *
     * ## `role="alert"` is gone, and that is not a downgrade
     *
     * An alert demands immediate announcement and is for something that has
     * just happened. This is a standing property of the page, true before
     * the reader arrived and still true when they leave. As a `<summary>`
     * it is in the tab order, states its own expanded/collapsed state, and
     * can be returned to — which an alert that fires once cannot.
     *
     * ## "The full report" is the EXISTING panel, not a second one
     *
     * The page already carries a Translation QA badge that opens a panel
     * over the real sidecar. Restating its contents here would be a second
     * answer to one question, free to disagree — the defect this file warns
     * about in several other places. So the drawer holds the two facts that
     * are NOT in that panel (which file this translates, and how to sign it
     * off) and a control that opens the panel itself.
     *
     * The badge is looked up AT CLICK TIME, not here: it is built further
     * down this same function, so it does not exist yet. When there is no
     * badge — a page with no projection — the control is not drawn at all
     * rather than drawn dead (`pb04`).

   * `✓ ! ✕` carry their meaning on their own, survive monochrome, and keep
   * colour as reinforcement rather than as the message.
   *
   * **Two states carry no mark at all, and they are not the same state.**
   * `empty` is a subject that WAS swept and whose every criterion came back
   * `n/a`; a subject nobody has swept never reaches this map: its key is in
   * the index's `unswept` list and `qaPaintInert` turns it into a dulled

   * server-rendered until bean `4l4d`; it moved to the index because whether a
   * sidecar exists is a fact about the fetched QA corpus, not the checkout.)
   * Any glyph on either would be a claim about a check that returned no
   * verdict.
   *
   * **`unknown` is the third state and it is NOT a quiet pass.** `?` is loud
   * on purpose: a badge that could not read its verdict must not look like one
   * that read a clean one. This repository has paid for that collapse before —
   * an absent simulators directory rendered as "this folio has no simulators",

   *
   * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"when a document or other indexed object is opened,
   * the document index/idices are shown in a navbar tab/menu."*
   *
   * `navbar.ts` has carried a `documentIndex` region since it was written and
   * NOTHING SUPPLIED ONE -- a repo-wide search on 2026-09-22 found the type,
   * the render branch and a single test. `documentIndexOf` now supplies it on
   * every mounted page, server-side, from the HTML being injected into.
   *
   * THIS HALF IS SCRIPTED AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE, not an oversight.
   * The rail is injected into documents copied verbatim from instances the
   * harness does not control, where "injecting a nav is one claim and
   * injecting script is a larger one" -- so it must be server-side. This site
   * is ours, already loads this file, and Jekyll hands Liquid no way to see a
   * page's rendered headings: kramdown assigns the ids downstream of the
   * template. A build step that re-parsed our own output to learn what
   * kramdown had just done would be a second renderer.
   *
   * The SELECTION RULE is `navbar.ts`'s, restated rather than approximated:
   * `h2`/`h3` that carry an `id`, because a heading with no id is not a
   * destination (`pb04`); nested by level; and the region is ABSENT rather
   * than empty below two rows, since a "Contents" holding the one section the
   * reader is looking at is a row that buys nothing in a region that does not
   * scroll.
   *
   * It mounts as a `.side-bar` child so the region rules in docs-ui.css make
   * it fixed-top with no further styling: `.side-bar > * { flex: 0 0 auto }`.

       * shown rather than omitted, because a reader cannot otherwise tell "no
       * viewer yet" from "no such graph". Two obligations come with it:
       *
       * - `gjli` — it must not read as a CONTROL. A `<span>`, never an `<a>`
       *   or a `<button>`, and nothing that takes focus: a greyed thing that
       *   accepts a tab and then does nothing costs a keyboard user an
       *   interaction to discover it is dead.
       * - The state is in TEXT. This row carried it as `opacity: 0.35`, a
       *   strikethrough and a `title` tooltip — a channel a keyboard or
       *   screen-reader user never reaches, and a hover a touch user cannot
       *   produce.
       *
       * AND THE WORDING IS CARRIED, NOT COMPOSED. `note` comes from
       * `harness-tiles.ts`, which computes it where the FOUR inert states are
       * already told apart — staging-only, exempt by declaration, built but
       * unreachable, nobody built it. The single string this used to write was
       * one wording for four states and wrong for two of them, which is the
       * defect `HarnessVisualisation.note`'s own docstring names. The harness
       * tabs and the rail have rendered this note as text all along; only this
       * row did not.

  /* ── THE RAIL'S LAYOUT, ON A THEME PAGE ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Owner ruling on bean ob3m finding 7, 2026-10-01, option 1 of 4: *"Use the
   * viewer-rail layout on Jekyll pages."* The generated viewer rail
   * (`lib/navbar.ts`, #1762) has ONE scroller holding the page's own section
   * first and a folded "Graphs" group after it. This sidebar had three
   * regions that each capped and scrolled on their own, and the measurement
   * that settled it was taken on the built landing page at 1280x800 with
   * every group unfolded: the middle at its 128px floor, 0 of the 430 page
   * links visible because FOLDERS (789px) sat above them, the harness group
   * scrolling inside the footer, and `.side-bar` clipping 2108px of content
   * into 800. Two nested scrollers and a column that hid what it could not fit.
   *
   * So, inside the one middle region and in this order:
   *
   *   1. "On this page" -- first, as the ruling says, and still folded on
   *      arrival (*"any indices/toc should be closed"*, 2026-09-23).
   *   2. The page list -- the only group open on arrival, so it gets the
   *      height. The rail's `single-open` rule, applied to this surface.
   *   3. "Folders" -- a TOP-LEVEL section of its own, folded on arrival,
   *      with no "Graphs" wrapper around it. Owner's ruling on #2150,
   *      2026-10-05, option (a): *"Folders becomes its own top-level section
   *      on the Jekyll sidebar, next to "On this page" and "Pages". Drop the
   *      Jekyll Graphs wrapper, which would otherwise be empty."* That
   *      SUPERSEDES this ruling's original step 3, which put FOLDERS inside a
   *      folded "Graphs" group -- so a folded Graphs hid Folders, and the
   *      owner read it as gone (*"there used to be"*). Its heading takes the
   *      slot Graphs had: pinned to the scroller's bottom while folded, above
   *      ▦, so it is one row away however long the page list is.
   *   4. "▦ Harnesses" -- the harness group, moved out of the footer, folded,
   *      LAST and BESIDE Folders rather than inside it. That is where the
   *      viewer rail keeps it too (`navbarHtml`: graphs in the middle,
   *      harnesses below them), and it is what keeps the owner's ruling on
   *      finding 1 (#1805): *"Make ▦ Harnesses visible on the landing page
   *      too"* -- ▦ is a mark in the 56px strip at rest and ONE click shows
   *      the harnesses. Folded inside another group it would be invisible at rest and
   *      two clicks away, which is the state that ruling removed. Both folded
   *      headings are pinned to the scroller's bottom edge, ▦ lowest, so the
   *      one-scroller property of this ruling is unchanged.
   *
   * MOVED, never re-rendered: the folder rows and the harness rows are the
   * nodes the generators already wrote, so their labels, notes and tooltips
   * are exactly what those generators say. This changes WHERE, not WHAT --
   * which is why the harness rows' `data-fa-tip` (#1805) still names their ⚙
   * after the move: `.side-bar [data-fa-tip]::after` is `position: fixed`, so
   * the scroller's `overflow` does not clip it.
   *
   * The footer keeps home, which is the one destination `navbar.ts` pins below
   * everything (*"keep home at bottom"*). Only the sidebar's own footer is
   * touched: just-the-docs renders the same include a second time for the
   * phone layout, outside `.side-bar`, and that copy is not this region.

  /* ── STAY CLOSED, REMEMBERED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Owner, 2026-09-23: *"need mechansim for closing harness navabar (e.g. w/
   * all pages)"*, with a screenshot of the bar open and nothing to press.
   *
   * ## The bar had ONE state bit and needed two
   *
   * `#fa-nav-open` is checked (pinned open) or clear (default). It ALSO opens
   * on hover and on focus, and `[x]` was shown only while pinned — so a bar
   * opened by a pointer had no control, and a touch reader, who has no
   * pointer to move away, had no way at all. Nothing persisted either: every
   * navigation started over.
   *
   * The owner chose the three-state answer over the two smaller ones:
   * pinned-open, default peek, and STAY CLOSED — remembered across pages.
   *
   * ## `[x]` cannot just be a label in the hover case
   *
   * It is a `<label for="fa-nav-open">` and a label TOGGLES. Pinned, that is
   * right and works with no script — a property this file protects. Open by
   * hover the checkbox is already clear, so the same click would CHECK it and
   * pin the bar open: the opposite of what the control says. So that click is
   * intercepted here, and the stylesheet only offers `[x]` in the hover case
   * when `.fa-nav-js` says this ran.
   *
   * ## What is stored, and what happens when it cannot be
   *
   * One key, one of two values, per browser. `localStorage` throws in a
   * private window and in previews, so every read and write is guarded and a
   * failure degrades to the previous behaviour rather than to a broken
   * navbar — the preference is a convenience, not state anything else needs.

   * lives here, where every page gets it, rather than in each generator.
   *
   * A table qualifies when it has more than TABLE_FILTER_MIN body rows at
   * load. Tables built later by a viewer's own script are not seen, and that
   * is deliberate: those viewers own their controls. `data-fa-no-filter` on
   * the table, or on anything around it, opts out.
   *
   * Matching is on the row's text, case-insensitive, and every word typed must
   * appear (AND), so "lean proof" narrows rather than widens. A hidden row is
   * `hidden`, not removed, so clearing the box restores the table exactly. The

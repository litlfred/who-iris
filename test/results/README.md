# qa

What auditing THIS instance produced, committed so a consumer can tell "never audited" from "audited clean" — a printed verdict cannot, which is why every QA verdict here is a sidecar. TWO kinds live here and the files declare which they are via $schema: kg-qa/v1, one per audited subject, in a tree mirroring the subject’s own path, and ONE kg-qa-manifest/v1 recording the auditor’s identity for all of them. The manifest moved here from skills/ on 2026-09-27: kg-audit.ts writes it unconditionally, so its old home created a skills/ directory holding no skills in every instance that has none. At declaration time that is 2 files across scenarios (1), skills (1). No qa-results/v1 and no witnesses: this instance runs no document build and no witness-producing computation, and declaring kinds it does not hold would be an over-claim. dependents: reproduce, because a dependent audits its OWN graph — these verdicts are about this instance’s nodes, and inheriting them would attribute one instance’s findings to another. Declared WITH its files in one commit, per bean dh4f: a declared-but-absent directory makes a consumer scan nothing and report a clean run over it.

Part of [WHO IRIS](../../README.md) 0.1.0, declared as `qa`, holding `qa`.

/**
 * The two WHO themes, bean `j66n`.
 *
 * @module who-iris/themes/themes
 * @graphNode themes
 *
 * ## Why these live in `who-iris/` and not in `cat-harness/schemas/themes.ts`
 *
 * The platform ships twelve themes and they are the platform's own furniture.
 * These two are **WHO's**, derived from WHO's artefacts, and the root
 * `AGENTS.md` states the line they would cross: *"If you are about to write
 * subject matter here, you are either in the wrong repo or writing something
 * that belongs in the folio as data."* A palette read off a WHO style guide is
 * subject matter.
 *
 * They still go through the platform's `resolveTheme` with
 * `instance: "who-iris"` rather than a shortcut, which is what
 * `themes.ts` already anticipated in prose — *"They go through the same
 * function a who-iris theme will"*. That sentence is now true.
 *
 * ## Two sources, one artefact — which is what makes this the worked example
 *
 * `wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng` is both:
 *
 *   - the **item whose IRIS page** carries a DSpace deployment's theme, and
 *   - the **document whose contents** are the WHO publication rules.
 *
 * So `iris-web` is measured from the captured page assets and
 * `who-wpro-publication` from the ingested document's own text. Neither is
 * read off a screenshot and neither is inferred from the other.
 *
 * ## Every value below is measured, and the tests read the SOURCES
 *
 * `themes.test.ts` does not compare these constants against a copy of
 * themselves. It re-reads `client-theme.css` out of the committed capture zip
 * and the style guide's ingested page text, and asserts the values here match
 * what those files say. If the capture is ever re-taken and IRIS has
 * re-skinned, the tests fail rather than the theme quietly describing a site
 * that no longer looks like this.
 *
 * ## Two contradictions IN THE SOURCE, recorded rather than resolved
 *
 * Neither is a transcription error on our side; both are what the document
 * says, and `RECORDED_CONTRADICTIONS` below is asserted by a test so a later
 * tidy-up cannot quietly drop them.

/**
 * `iris-web` — the IRIS deployment's own theme.
 *
 * Source: `who-iris/uploads/wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng/iris-capture/Publication and
 * information products style guide_files.zip`, member `client-theme.css`
 * (570,732 bytes), the compiled theme DSpace served with the item page.
 *
 * ## The palette, role by role, with the declaration each came from
 *
 * | role | value | read from |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `surface` | `#ffffff` | `body{…background-color:#fff}` |
 * | `ink` | `#212529` | `body{…color:#212529}` |
 * | `edge` | `#ced4da` | `--ds-header-navbar-border-bottom-color` |
 * | `accent` | `#008dc9` | `--primary` |
 *
 * **`--blue: #2B4E72` is NOT the accent**, though it is the most
 * brand-looking value in the file. Bootstrap's `--blue` is a *scale* entry;
 * `--primary` is the *role*, and DSpace sets them to different values here
 * precisely because they answer different questions. Taking the prettier one
 * would be the hardcoding `theme.ts` exists to end, one level up.
 *
 * **No gradient.** The source declares none, and a theme may not invent one —
 * `ThemePaletteSchema` refuses a single-stop gradient anyway.
 *
 * ## Geometry: column widths, not breakpoints
 *
 * `ThemeGeometry.minWidth` is documented as *"minimum column width before the
 * grid reflows"*. The obvious fill is `--breakpoint-lg: 992px`, and it is a
 * category error — a breakpoint is a viewport, not a column. The values below
 * are real column widths the stylesheet declares:
 *
 *   - `1140px` — the widest `.container{max-width:…}` in the file (540 / 720 /
 *     960 / 1140 all occur).
 *   - `100%` — `.container` carries no `max-width` outside those rules, so the
 *     narrow case is fluid.
 *   - `250px` — `--ds-sidebar-items-width`, the narrowest column DSpace names.
 *
 * `fontScale` is `1` at every size, and that is a MEASUREMENT rather than a
 * placeholder: `body{…font-size:1rem}` and the file declares no per-breakpoint
 * body scale. The platform's sticky themes use 1.05 / 0.95; copying those here
 * would have described a site this one is not.

/**
 * `who-wpro-publication` — the WHO Western Pacific publication theme.
 *
 * Source: the ingested style guide itself,
 * `who-iris/library/wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng/sections/`, which is the document
 * that *states* these rules rather than a site that happens to use them.
 *
 * ## The palette
 *
 * | role | value | read from |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `surface` | `#ffffff` | the page. See below — this one is definitional, not measured. |
 * | `ink` | `#000000` | page 6, `K: 100`. One side of a recorded contradiction. |
 * | `edge` | `#74CEE2` | page 12, primary palette, lightest blue (`R: 116 G: 206 B: 226`) |
 * | `accent` | `#0093D5` | page 6 AND page 12, `R: 0 G: 147 B: 213` — the WPRO logo blue |
 *
 * **`edge` is the one value in this theme that is a CHOICE, and it is flagged
 * rather than dressed up.** The guide states no rule, border or divider colour
 * anywhere in its 33 pages — grepped, not assumed. So `edge` takes the
 * lightest blue of the palette the guide *does* state, instead of a
 * plausible-looking grey from nowhere. It is the field to overrule first, and
 * a test pins it to membership of the stated primary palette so a future edit
 * cannot drift it out of the brand while looking harmless.
 *
 * `surface` is white because that is the page. The guide states no paper tint
 * anywhere, and for a print theme an unstated substrate is not a gap the way
 * an unstated rule colour is.
 *
 * ## Geometry: the three PRINT formats, from page 18
 *
 * *"Frequently used formats and specs"* — A4 `21 cm x 29.7 cm`, A5
 * `14.8 cm x 21 cm`, A5 landscape `21 cm x 14.8 cm`. Kept in the source's own
 * units, as `PrintGeometrySchema` requires: rewriting `29.7cm` as millimetres
 * is a conversion nobody asked for and a chance to be wrong.
 *
 * `margin` is the **1 cm logo exclusion zone** from page 7 (*"at least 1cm
 * width distance"*), cited as such and not as a page margin — the guide states
 * no page margin, and `PrintGeometrySchema`'s own doc comment already fixed
 * this convention for exactly this document.
 *
 * `fontScale` is `1` on A4 and A5 alike. Page 14 gives the primary typefaces
 * at **10 pt** for all four — News Gothic MT, DIN OT, PT Sans, Calibri — with
 * no format-dependent size, so a scale that varied by format would be stating
 * a rule the guide does not have.
